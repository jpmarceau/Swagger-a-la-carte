          If the results of a specific request are available in the cache, and if
          those results are no older than the `maximumAge` value, the service returns
          those results rather than forwarding a new query to the index.


          The default `maximumAge` value (`-1`) is equivalent to the organization
          default, which is usually 15 minutes.

          You can pass an empty `pipeline` value to use an empty query pipeline (i.e.,

          If your request does not contain the `pipeline` parameter, the first query
          pipeline whose conditions are met by the request is used (query pipelines
          without conditions are not evaluated). Should the request fail to meet the
          conditions of each evaluated query pipeline, the default query pipeline
          of the target Coveo Cloud organization is used (bypassing its conditions,
          if it has any).

          If your request does not contain the `pipeline` parameter, the first query
          pipeline whose conditions are met by the request is used (query pipelines
          without conditions are not evaluated). Should the request fail to meet the
          conditions of each evaluated query pipeline, the default query pipeline
          of the target Coveo Cloud organization is used (bypassing its conditions,
          if it has any).

          Query ranking function expressions support the [ExprTk](http://www.partow.net/programming/exprtk/index.html)

          - `repeat until`

          - `NOW`: A value corresponding to the precise moment when the query reaches
          the index.

          - `YEAR`: A value corresponding to the duration of a year (i.e., 365.25
          days).

          - `WEEK`: A value corresponding to the duration of a week.

          - `DAY`: A value corresponding to the duration of a day.


          **Tip:**

          > If your query ranking function expression references certain numeric fields,
          you should ensure that the **Use cache for computed fields** option is enabled
          for each of those fields in order to speed up evaluation (see [Add/Edit
